### 1. Create Room (Initial)

Content-Type: application/json

{
  "number": "999",
  "capacity": 2,
  "pricePerNight": 100,

### 2. Create Room (Duplicate) - Should Fail
POST {{base_url}}/rooms
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "number": "999",
  "capacity": 2,
  "pricePerNight": 100,
  "type": "Standard"
}

### 3. Update Room (Duplicate) - Should Fail
# First create another room to update
POST {{base_url}}/rooms
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "number": "998",
  "capacity": 2,
  "pricePerNight": 100,
  "type": "Standard"
}

# Then try to update it to "999" (which exists)
# Replace {id} with the ID of room 998 (likely 2 if DB was empty, but we can't know for sure without running)
# For reproduction, we assume the user will run this and see the result.
